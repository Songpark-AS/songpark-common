(defn init
  "Initiates a simple mqtt connection using machine head.
   Expects a topic name.
   Uses default URI: \"tcp://127.0.0.1:1883\", unless other URI is specified

(defn publish
  "Publishes code to mqtt server
   Expects a connection, a topic, and a map with :pointer and :arguments
   \"pointer\" should be a vector of keys, that specifies the position of a handler function in a clojure map
   Consider the following handler map:

   (def handler-map {:a {:c str 
                         :b +} 
                     :d -})

   The \"+\" function has the following pointer: [:a :b].
   it may be supplied the following arguments: [1 2 3]
   Result would be =6
   Example uses:
   
   (publish my-connection my-topic {:pointer [:a :b] :arguments [1 2 3]})
   (publish connection-map [[:a :b][1 2 3]])"
